Idea: Incorporating an interactive feature that follows a users mouse in the viewport / intro to each page

The concept: I plan to incporporate an iridicent / glass effect that lingers and follows a users mouse as they interact with the top portion of each of my pages where the title of the project would be. Right now I have created an exmaple that mimics glass panes and follows the users mouse like I want it to. I still have to code this out but I think there are some changes that I would like to implement if I can figure it out. These changes consist of the lingering colour of the interactive element and the overall shape. This colour could consist of a colour that matches the palette specifically on the page, however I am unsure of how to accomplish this and need to research more. I was thinking of changing the shapes of the effect to match the shape of the star in my logo, which is displayed in the photos provided.

Purpose: I want to include this to mimic stars / movement / glass in my site to match my branding and the logo that is positioned in the centre of my landing page. I feel that incporotating this feature will bring my portfolio to life and result in users resonating with my site and getting a better understanding of my personality and the 'vibes' I am trying to incorporate into my work. By doing this I am hoping employers and potential partners can get a fell of my drive, personality, and style.

Resources: Resources I plan to use for this project consist of React, youtube videos and explanations, framer, and some assistance from AI with Cursor and Claude

Uncertainties: While I have many resources and exmaples to help with coding this feature I am worried about relying too heavily on assisting methods rather then trying to figure it out myself. While I understand how valuable it is to have these resources sometimes I feel I rely on them a bit more then I should be. To combat this I have been researching and watching a lot of interactive incorporation videos about code and things that I could do to get a better understanding of what I want to accomplish. In pair with this I have been reviewing class slides, lessons, and will reach out to my professors if I hit a roaldblock first.
